HR Copilot - Scoring Mechanism (Red-Amber-Green Cards)

ðŸŸ¢ Green Card - Ideal Interview Conditions
All criteria must be met:
- Exactly 1 person present
- Same person as registered profile
- Face centered at screen/camera
- No distracting gadgets or materials detected
- Face clearly visible and well-lit
- Live image (not static/fake)

ðŸŸ¡ Amber Card - Minor Issues
One or more of these conditions:
- Looking away (head pose slightly off) for > 15 sec continuously
- 1-2 non-critical objects detected (laptop, keyboard - normal work setup) -> give alerts to put them away
- Face partially obscured but still identifiable
- Moderate lighting or image quality issues

Score: -20 for one amber card
- Continue interview with monitoring alerts
- 3 amber cards = 1 Red 
- Suppose 1 amber card is issued -> strict monitoring for the next 5 minutes and if another violation 
  is detected within these 5 minutes -> issue a red card directly otherwise continue
- Amber cards expire after 5 minutes of good behavior

ðŸ”´ Red Card - Major Violations
Any one of these triggers immediate red card:
- More than 1 person detected
- Different person than registered
- Phone, second screen, or printed materials detected
- Not looking at screen for extended periods
- Static/fake image detected
- Face not visible or undetectable

Score: -50 for one red card
- Interview integrity compromised - immediate action required
- List violations and terminate/reschedule
- No appeals or second chances during the same session
